            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              For over ten years, I've been learning Chinese. Like many, my journey was sparked by the captivating world of Taiwanese dramas. I was hooked by the storylines, the culture, and the way the language was used in everyday life. It became my secret learning tool.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Deep down, I also held onto a secret dream: to one day be an actor in one of those dramas. While traditional apps taught me vocabulary, they couldn't teach me how to deliver lines with the right emotion or how to react in a scene.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              As a product manager in the tech industry, I saw an opportunity to merge my passions. I wanted to build something that could help others like me live out that same dreamâ€”to step into the shoes of a drama character and practice Chinese in a way that's fun, immersive, and truly unforgettable.
